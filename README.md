# GRK

Final project for the Graphics Programming Subject. 

This scene rendered in OpenGL showcases the following functionalities:
- A window through which you will see the sky as a skybox
- Fully textured objects using PBR as lighting model (desk, bed, chair, cupboardâ€¦)
- Different lighting sources (lamp, window) casting shadows
- Moving the camera around to show the whole scene
- A moving object (or objects) that can be controlled (scene interactivity)
- All graphic solutions presented during the classes
- Documentation 1-2 pages

Besides, there are 2 major algorithms which are not decided yet.
